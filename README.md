Purpose: to understand the structure of the driving system and steering system of an RC car  

### Driving system

Seeing that the RC car's driving system was greased, I realized that applying grease to the driving system of my own build would be beneficial as well.

It has four gears. I initially thought two would be enough, so I'm not sure why multiple gears are used. However, it's clear they weren't for transmission, since the RC car doesn't have a shifting mechanism.

Finally its motor is combined with capacitor. I'm not sure why it was used. But, I could guess it was used to stabilize the signal from remote controller.

### Steering system

This is the tructure of steering system. The shape of streering is unique. Therefore, it seems difficult to reference anything other than the mechanism of the axis.  

Its motor is also combined with capacitor. And I could guess it was used to stabilize the signal from remote controller.
